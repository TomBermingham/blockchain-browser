Note: the test network is not 100% reliable, refresh the page if you get an error.

### Intro
The web started with documents and hyperlinks. You could use a browser to explore. This is missing in Web3.
You can do this by building a "browser in a browser".
Smart contracts serve HTML, the contract addresses become URLs.
The long term goal is to either make a dedicated browser or make it possible in Chrome.
