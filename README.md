Note: the test network is not 100% reliable, refresh the page if you get an error.

### An intuitive internet
Imagine the internet as a child would imagine it:
- you create a website on "the internet" instead of finding a specific provider like AWS,
- you make a website by going to the URL you want to have and pressing "create",
- you update a website by viewing source, making a change, then pressing save.
And on top of this you have:
- zero recurring hosting costs,
- no need to integrate with authentication or payment services.
And as a user:
- you never have to login or remember passwords again, you're logged into every website by default,
- you can pay for anything by clicking a button (and know it's secure),
- no more remembering to cancel free trails.

### Back to the foundations of the web
The web started with documents and hyperlinks. You could use a browser to explore. This is missing in Web3.
You can do this by building a "browser in a browser".
Smart contracts serve HTML, the contract addresses become URLs.
The long term goal is to either make a dedicated browser or make it possible in Chrome.
